To provide guidance for adding/editing Chinese common names on iNaturalist.

Currently, the repo covers only the species observed in mainland China on iNaturalist.
It is based on observation data exported from iNat, and will be updated once a year.

(To completely match the names we need a taxon-based export tool from iNat)
Mismatched names can also be results of taxonomic diffrences, which is also not considered.

Note that this is going to be a batch automation program, 
curators still need to manually check and patch the names.
(Being a lazy guy, I only focus on those I encounter.)
